# Kenya Agricultural Production Analysis

A Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) and Data Analytics project. This analyzes Kenyan county-level agricultural and demographic data to provide insights for sustainability and food security planning.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Transform raw data into strategic insights via cleaning, descriptive analysis, visualizations, and policy metrics.
- **Parts**:
  - Part 1: Data cleaning and descriptive stats (e.g., total farming households: 6.35M).
  - Part 2: MEL logic, primary sector classification, and metrics (e.g., Crop Intensity, Agricultural Engagement Rate).
- **Key Outputs**: Cleaned data, visualizations (PNG), summary stats, and a presentation outline.

Data sourced from Kenyan county agricultural datasets (2019). See `docs/presentation_content.md` for full details.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/Ocholar/county-agricultural-production-analysis.git
cd county-agricultural-production-analysis

 2. Set up virtual environment:
 python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the analysis:
python scripts/analysis.py
- This cleans the data, generates stats, and saves visualizations to `outputs/`.
- Note: The script assumes the raw data is at `data/project_data_set.csv`. Outputs save to `outputs/` (update paths if needed).

## Data
- `project_data_set.csv`: Raw data with counties, households, crop/livestock metrics, etc.
- `cleaned_project_dataset.csv`: Processed version after cleaning (e.g., removed non-counties, fixed types).

## Visualizations
Examples (generated by `analysis.py`):
- Top 10 Counties by Crop Production.
- Sub-sector comparisons.
- Primary sector distribution.
- Engagement vs. Density scatter plot.

## Presentation
- See `docs/presentation_content.md` for content outline.
- Full PPTX in `docs/presentation.pptx` (includes slides on quality issues, metrics, recommendations).

## Limitations
- Data is from 2019; may need updates.
- Script generates files to `/home/ubuntu/agricultural_analysis/` – modify paths for your environment.
- No actual images attached; generate via script.

## Contributing
Fork and PR improvements (e.g., add Jupyter notebook, update data).
